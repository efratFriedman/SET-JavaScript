**🃏 Set Game - JavaScript Web App**

An interactive browser-based version of the classic Set card game - built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
Designed to provide a smooth, intuitive, and playful user experience with sound, animations, and game logic.


**🎯 Game Objective**
Find a **Set** - a winning combination of 3 cards out of 12 shown on the table - according to specific visual rules.

Each card has **4 attributes**:

- **Shape** - Oval, Diamond, or Squiggle

- **Color** - Red, Green, or Purple

 - **Number** - 1, 2, or 3 symbols

- **Fill** - Solid, Striped, or Outline

To form a **valid Set**, for **each of the four attributes**, the three cards must be:

✔️ All the same
or
✔️ All different

**⚠️ Golden Rule:** If only two cards share a value in one attribute (e.g. two red and one green), it's not a valid Set.
